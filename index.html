  <h1>Discover Isan</h1>
  <p>Explore the hidden soul of Thailand: nature, silk, food, and traditions from the heart of the northeast.</p>
</header>

<section id="about">
  <h2>Welcome to Isan</h2>
  <p>Isan, Thailand’s northeastern region, is a land of quiet contrast — where vibrant rice paddies stretch across flatlands and ancient ruins rise from red earth. Despite being the largest region in Thailand (covering about one-third of the country), it remains one of the least known internationally. Yet, it is rich in cultural identity, folklore, and a resilient spirit.</p>
  <p>Isan is home to over 22 million people, with most communities engaged in agriculture, crafts, and emerging tourism. While it has long been seen as rural and underdeveloped, that view is rapidly changing as travelers, entrepreneurs, and investors discover its unique offerings.</p>
  <h3>A Brief History of Isan</h3>
  <p>Isan’s story is shaped by ancient civilizations, migration, and resilience. It shares cultural and linguistic ties with Laos, as much of its population speaks a Lao dialect and practices similar customs. Historically, the region was influenced by the Khmer Empire, and many ruins such as Phanom Rung and Prasat Hin Phimai reflect this legacy.</p>
  <p>During the Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin periods, Isan became more integrated into Siam (Thailand), though economic and geographic barriers kept it isolated for centuries. In the 20th century, waves of migration to Bangkok and abroad brought remittances but also a sense of cultural marginalization. Today, Isan is regaining pride as it becomes more connected and celebrated for its heritage and creativity.</p>
</section>

<section id="crafts">
  <h2>Arts & Crafts</h2>
  <p>Isan’s creative expression lives in its villages — in hand-dyed silks, bamboo weaving, earthenware pottery, and festivals that combine art, music, and community ritual.</p>
  <div class="craft-columns">
    <div>
      <h3>Silk Weaving</h3>
      <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/400x300/?thai-silk" alt="Silk weaving placeholder">
      <p>Isan silk is world-renowned, particularly from provinces like Surin and Khon Kaen. Using mudmee (ikat) and natural dyeing techniques, artisans produce patterns that reflect local myths and beliefs. Each piece can take weeks to complete and is often woven at home by women using traditional wooden looms.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Bamboo Craft</h3>
      <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/400x300/?bamboo,thailand" alt="Bamboo craft placeholder">
      <p>Bamboo is both a symbol of resilience and a practical material in Isan. Villagers weave baskets, trays, fish traps, and even furniture. The designs blend beauty and function, often passed through generations.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Pottery</h3>
      <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/400x300/?pottery,thailand" alt="Pottery craft placeholder">
      <p>In Ban Chiang (Udon Thani), prehistoric pottery was unearthed that dates back over 5,000 years — now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Today, artisans still shape pots and ceramic wares by hand, often for cooking or temple use.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Other Crafts</h3>
      <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/400x300/?thai-crafts" alt="Other crafts placeholder">
      <p>Additional crafts include dyeing with indigo and herbs (Sakon Nakhon), knife-making and metalwork (Nakhon Ratchasima), handmade musical instruments like the khaen, and palm leaf weaving and lantern making for festivals.</p>
